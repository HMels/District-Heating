# District Heating

District Heating is a tool written by Mels Habold for his internship at ZEnMo. This tool creates a digital twin of a neighbourhood (in this case Apeldoorn Noord or in Rotterdam) and allows the user to play around with some buttons which change the energy dependencies of this neighbourhood. This tool utilizes code from a lot of different other tools created by ZEnMo, but mostly it looks at the impact of having a heating network in your neighbourhood as opposed to having local boilers. 

### Installation

This tool is based in the Agent Based Language called Anylogic, which combines a visual mode of programming with javascript. Installment can be done by installing Anylogic via their site. Warning, a student licence is needed.

### Features

This tool looks at the costs (both investing and operational) and environmental impacts. Additionally, the tool also has modelled the energy needs of industries, whereas normally it only looks at households. It is also possible to download objects from ESDL (specifically the Map editor). The tool consists of an underlying model and a graphical interface layerd above it. 

More information about the underlying model can be found in the internship report.
